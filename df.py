    DataFetcher is a class that simplifies querying the data store
    with maximal query parallelism and cache utilization.

    It requires the asynctools package, which you can obtain at
    http://code.google.com/p/asynctools/.

    When used properly, DataFetcher ensures the following:

    - All the data fetches that could be parallelized are parallelized (both
      when fetching from the data store and from memcache).
    - All fetched data is stored in memcache and in a local per process cache.
      The data for a given cachekey is only fetched from memcache if it's
      missing from the local cache, and it's only fetched from the data store
      if it's missing from memcache.
    - Simultaneous requests for the same cache key are combined into a single
      request.


    A simple example showing how to fetch a single object:
        
    def request_cat(fetcher):
      ref = fetcher.request_obj(Cat, cat_id)
      yield ref.get
          
    fetcher = DataFetcher()
    requester_ref = spawn(requester_cat)
    fetcher.run()
    cat = requester_ref.get()


    A more complex example, showing how to fetch multiple related objects:

    def requester(cat_id, fetcher):
      cat_ref = fetcher.request_obj(Cat, cat_id)
      yield
      cat = cat_ref.get()
      friend_id = cat.friend_id
      friend_ref = fetcher.request_obj(Cat, friend_id)

      def ondone():
        cat.friend = friend_ref.get()
        return cat

      yield ondone

    cat_ids = [123, 456]
    requesters = [functools.partial(requester, id) for id in cat_ids]
    fetcher = DataFetcher()
    refs = fetcher.spawn_multi(requesters)
    fetcher.run()

    cats = [ref.get() for ref in refs]
    friends = [cat.friend for cat in cat]

      
    For an overview on how to use it please read the accompanying
    README.txt file or see the examples in the unit tests.

        Adds the requester function to the list of functions
        that should be executed in the DataFetcher's main "thread".

        The requester function should take a single parameter, which is
        the DataFetcher object that runs the requester.

        Requester functions typically have a sequence of
        request() or request_obj() calls that request independent
        sets of data that can be fetched in parallel.
        If two or more data fetches depend on each other (for
        example, if a requester fetches an object and a related object
        whose id is only known once the first object has been fetched),
        the requester can call 'yield' between calls to request().
        After a call to 'yield', all the data from the previous
        calls to request() and request_obj() should have been
        fetched if no errors have occurred.

        In their last yield statement, requesters can return a callable object.
        The result of the callable object will be set as the value of the
        Ref object that spawn() returns. The callable is called after the
        DataFetcher is done fetching all the requested data.

        spawn() can be called from within a requester function
        (in other words, requesters can spawn other requesters).
        This is useful if a requester wants to ensure the data from
        another requester is fetched before the DataFetcher's
        main thread ends (but not necessarily before the calling requester's
        next pass -- see spawn_and_join() for a different approach).

        Tip: If you want to create a generic requester function that
        takes more than the single DataFetcher parameter, you can
        use functools.partial to bind values to the requester's extra
        parameters before spawning it.

        See the example at the top of the file for details.
